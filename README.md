#                                                     Metagenomics pipeline

###### This pipeline performs a taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences resulting from second-generation technologies.

##  Introduction 
##### Metagenomics is a multi-application tool in virology. This technology has allowed the community to identify new viral sequences and expand our knowledge of the genomic structure, diversity, and ecology of currently known viral families. In this exploratory task, metagenomics has succeeded in identifying pathogenic viruses with zoonotic potential. However, it is possible that in the coming years, the impact of metagenomics will be even greater. New studies are using metagenomics as a tool to test or evaluate ecological and/or evolutionary hypotheses. Several of these projects also integrate metagenomics with other "omic" sciences, including genomics and transcriptomics, among others. It is possible that the empirical data generated from these analyzes could in the future improve and recalibrate epidemiological models that try to predict and anticipate new viral outbreaks. We developed a pipeline that allows processing and obtaining the classification of the sequences obtained in these metagenomic studies. This pipeline has been tested on a wide variety of samples, including environmental samples, feces, and swabs of different tissues from wild and domestic animals.
